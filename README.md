My implementation of an emulator for the hit 80s game console, the Nintendo Entertainment System. Based heavily on OneLoneCoder's implementation from https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES.

This emulator was built mostly as a learning experience into the realm of reverse engineering and low-level development, it is not meant for accuracy, compatibility, or fast gameplay. 
There are far better actual community developed emulators that do that job.
